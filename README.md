### Background
This project was initially built as part of my application to the Shopify internship program for back end development and production engineering. 
For this project I chose an Express server with PostgreSQL for the database. The project uses the node-postgres library for the database driver. I wanted to keep it fairly barebones/lightweight to avoid adding unnecessary complexity and keep it performant. 

### Install
- Fork/Clone Repo
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Create a `.env` file based on the existing `sample.env` configured with your secrets
  * This project is currently deployed live on replit which does not require configuring your own Postgres database instance / credentials.
